# Overview


This is a quick example of how to wrap a C++ constructor.

You could use this to implement a visitor pattern later on for your design.

Ideally, intercepting function calls is a great way to test software as you can 
simulate failure conditions ( such as a network copy error , link being down ..etc )
without having to code a specific test condition into your program.
